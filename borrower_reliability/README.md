# Debtors data analysis (data preprocessing)
This project focuses on analyzing borrower data to investigate factors influencing the likelihood of loan default. The analysis explores various socio-demographic characteristics of clients, such as marital status, the presence of children, and other factors, to understand their impact on debt repayment.

## Task

The main objectives of the project are:
- To determine the relationship between a client's marital status and their likelihood of becoming a debtor.
- To explore the influence of other factors, such as the number of children, on the probability of loan default.
- To present the findings in easily interpretable tables and visualizations.

## Results

Clients without children and those with higher incomes tend to repay loans more reliably, while single clients and those borrowing for non-real estate purposes are at higher risk of default. These insights should be considered in the bank's credit scoring models to improve loan risk assessment.
