# Comparative analysis of music listening habits (introduction to Python and pandas)
This project analyzes music streaming data to compare the listening habits of users from two cities, Alpha and Beta, using data from MusicHub. The goal is to explore how user activity and genre preferences differ between these cities.

## Task

1. Determine if user activity varies by day of the week between City Alpha and City Beta.
2. Identify whether different genres dominate in City Alpha and City Beta on Monday mornings and Friday evenings.
3. Explore whether City Alpha prefers pop music and City Beta has a stronger inclination towards rap.

## Results

- **User Activity**: Confirmed distinct activity patterns between the cities on different days of the week.
- **Genre Preferences**: Both cities have similar top genres, with minor differences; rap was not more popular in Beta as hypothesized.
- **City-Specific Preferences**: Pop dominates in Alpha, but genre preferences are more alike than expected across the cities.
